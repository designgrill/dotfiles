# Dotfiles
WIP

## New Machine Setup
READ THE INSTRUCTIONS SPECIFIC TO YOUR MACHINE TYPE IN RESPECTIVE FOLDER

### Step By Step
0. Download the zip of this repo so that you can run few scripts.
0. Go to `macos/install` or similar and run the scripts as needed. You will need to run this only once per machine.
0. Run spectacle so that its settings can be applied in the next step.
0. Add [dnscrypt-proxy plugin](https://getbitbar.com/plugins/Network/dnscrypt-proxy-switcher.10s.sh) to bitbar in Menu Bar.
0. Go to `macos/configure` or similar and run the scripts as needed. `macos.sh` might be the first one if you are running for macOS. Per user.
0. Setup the .ssh and other private home folders so that you can clone this repo and use that for symlinking.
0. Clone this repo
0. Setup the appropriate git config (user.name etc. specifically for this repo)
```
git config --local -e
```
0. In the repo root, use gnu stow to make config available to your home directory. Per user.
```
stow bash -t ~/ -v --ignore=.DS_Store      # will configure bash for you etc. It might error out if the file it is trying to symlink already exists, cleanup is up to you.
stow others -t ~/ -v --ignore=.DS_Store    # will configure lot of other smaller dotfiles at your home directory.
./vim.install.sh
stow vim -t ~/ -v --ignore=.DS_Store       # will configure vim. Run `./vim.install.sh` before that.
stow git -t ~/ -v --ignore=.DS_Store

mkdir -p ~/.config/
stow fish -t ~/.config/ -v --ignore=.DS_Store

mkdir -p ~/.aws/cli/
cd aws/
stow cli -t ~/.aws/cli/ -v --ignore=.DS_Store
```
0. `~/.config/fish/fish_variables` might be overwritten by fish time and again, you might have to keep syncing.
0. Install all atom plugins
```
apm login
apm stars --install
```
0. For Rectangle, import the config file from `macos/configure`
0. For OpenEmu, you need to select the USB gamepad in the controls section and map ALL the buttons one by one. Delete `"~/Library/Application Support/OpenEmu/Bindings/Default.oebindings"` if the USB game controllers are not working in OpenEmu. Also, you have to configure each and every button for it to work properly, and not just select the correct game pad.
0. For chrome extensions which you are using from Github, take a git checkout in`/Applications/From Github` folder and use from there. This is to ensure you can update them with a simple command when needed.
0. For BitBar extensions, create a `/Applications/From BitBar` folder and use that as a plugin directory.

## Exclusions
* Atom settings are synced using the `sync-settings` package which depends on github's gists.
* `sync-settings` package for Atom may not sync language specific settings like gfm soft wrap.

## ToDo
* Most of the Ubuntu options as they haven't been tested yet
* For brew install, check for packages with flags or with alternate names isn't done properly
* Have richer config for `others`
* Have a better bash_history config as in what should go in, duplicates, sharing in tabs etc.
* Have better config for git especially when it comes to mergetool, difftool, and aliases, attributes, ignores etc.
* Detailed configuration for vim
* Detailed configuration for tmux
* Detailed configuration for fish
* Explore alternatives to Terminal on macOS (iTerm 2?)
